# Literacy


"OG" Literacy:
> the ability to read and write.

More abstractly:
> competence or knowledge in a specified area.

*To be literate is to be able to read, understand, interpret and function in a domain.*


This gives rise to multiple additional notions of literacy:

- *mathematical literacy* [preferable to "numeracy" IMO]
- *computer literacy* [preferable to "digital literacy" IMO]
- *data literacy*


In general, if you want to assess your literacy, you do it outside the listed subject.

i.e.
- Test your literacy *outside* English classes.
- Test your mathematical literacy *outside* Maths classes.
- Test your computer literacy *outside* Digital Tech classes.
- Test your scientific literacy *outside* Science classes. 


When you're in maths classes, you're likely to be in
"maths mode", expecting maths problems. When you're not, you're not.

So outside maths classes you have to notice mathematical ideas
on your own and make the connection that there is an
opportunity here to attack a problem with maths knowledge.

<h2 style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Problem solving</h2>
</div>

STEM problems require you to quickly work to *make sense of problems* as they are presented, and work productively to propose *real and appropriate solutions*.


<div class="r-hstack">
<img src="https://stem.getintoenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/STEMIcons-creativity.png" />
<h2 style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Creativity</h2>
</div>

STEM requires the ability to look at and propose solutions to a problem through multiple approaches, including ones that are highly creative or “out-of-the-box.” In STEM, *mistakes and failed attempts are positive experiences*, offering opportunities for deeper learning.


Do we need to teach creativity, or do we need to *un*teach *un*creativity?

<h2 style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Inquiry skills</h2>
</div>

STEM requires *hands-on, active participation* to effectively solve problems. Students are the drivers of solutions and should be asking the questions, proposing the ideas, generating and *testing solutions*, and making *decisions based on data* to understand how to *refine ideas further*.


<div class="r-hstack">
<img src="https://stem.getintoenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/STEMIcons-math.png" />
<h2 style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Maths and science skills</h2>
</div>

The *mathematics and science skills you are learning in school are the foundation* of STEM and must be applied in pursuit of solutions. The math and science used to solve problems will connect to and *extend your coursework*, as well as highlight *connections between ideas and subject areas*.

<h2 style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Engineering-Design thinking</h2>
</div>

In solving STEM problems, the use of engineering-design thinking is vital. In this kind of thinking, you must *identify the problem* at hand, *research* potential solutions, *build* prototypes, *test*, redesign, test again, and *iterate* further as needed. Each step in the process moves you closer to creating a functional solution.


This is the **Design Process**, central to *Design & Tech*, *Digital Tech* and *Visual Arts*.

<h2 style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Critical thinking</h2>
</div>

Effective STEM learning requires you to *analyze information*, *evaluate* designs, *reflect on your thinking*, *synthesize new ideas*, and *propose creative solutions*. All of these skills are vital to becoming an independent, critical thinker.

<h2 style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Collaboration</h2>
</div>

*Big challenges are rarely solved by individuals*. Working on STEM problems also involves learning to work as a productive *part of a collaborative team*.

#### Big ticket items
## Normalising failure
- "Broken", "not understood", "not working" is the status quo.
- Once "working", we move onto the next part of the problem, and now it's not working again!
- Creativity is stifled by stigmatisation of failure.
- Design processes are also stifled by the stigmatisation of failure.

(HPE and sports, Music, Art/Design, D&T, DiT, Maths)

## Collaboration
- group work/team skills
- communication skills
- presenting your ideas
- running with the work of others
- wrestling with competing ideas
- holding an argument

(everything?)

Note: 
- Using computers effectively to minimise human work
    - automation, macros, shortcuts, scripting, etc.
- Understanding the limitations of digital systems
    - doesn't "think", no free context, full of human bias, potential for algorithmic error, etc.
- Ethics and citizenship issues which emerge through computer-centric society
    - Anonymity/identity, private/public data expectations, scale of online attacks/clashes vs in-person ones

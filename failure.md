# Failure is the default state


Our students are increasingly paralysed by a *fear of failure*.
But not being able to do something, or not knowing how to do something,
is the normal state of things. We need to rethink our (and their)
attitude to ignorance, incompetance and failure.


We only tackle things our students *can't do yet*;
if they can already do it, there's no need to teach it!


We ask our students to do assignments, projects, problems and the like.
They spend most of their time with these *not finished*;
if they finish one, we move on to the next problem!


If we are making something, it spends the vast majority of the time *not working*;
once it's working, we stop working on it!


What we can take from this is that *can't do yet*, *not finished* and *not working*
are the status quo, the default states of life.


Every time we manage to clear one of those hurdles, we pause for a
brief moment to celebrate, and then just as quickly find a new, bigger problem to work on,
and go back to *can't do yet*, *not finished* and *not working*.


Alsoâ€¦


- Creativity is stifled by stigmatisation of failure.
- Design processes are also stifled by the stigmatisation of failure.


- In real projects/problems there is generally not a "right answer".
- You can't know if you've found the best answer. (Thankfully it isn't relevant, anyway!)


Our students are increasingly paralysed by a *fear of failure*.
But not being able to do something, or not knowing how to do something,
is the normal state of things. We need to normalise ignorance, incompetance and failure.

Note that I said *normalise*, not *glorify*.

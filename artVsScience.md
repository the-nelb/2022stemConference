# Art vs Science

(no, not [the band](https://youtu.be/h7yRjD5yLv4?t=104))


We have a peculiar notion that there are inherently *creative* subjects
and inherently *rule-based* subjects.


### Examples
- Music
- Mathematics
- Art
- Physics


But this is misleading and downright untrue.

*Every* subject/discipline is both *creative* **and** *rule-based*.


To get *started* in any discipline, you must understand and use
the *knowledge, patterns and conventions* in that discipline.

To be
*successful* and noteworthy, you must bring creativity to your
work, along with a rich understanding of the "rules".

To be *exceptional*, you must push the boundaries of the
knowledge, patterns and conventions of the discipline. This
requires both extreme mastery of the "rules" and a high level
of creativity: lateral or divergent thinking.
